Project Name: Mini Challenge 2-4 Endpoints <br>
Project Description: Design an API with 3 Endpoints: <br> 
  
1. Endpoint that accepts 2 numbers.  Once you have the numbers, add them together and print out the results in a sentence. <br> 
     - Example results, "The sum of 2 and 2 is 4." <br> 

2. Endpoint that accepts 2 inputs. You will take the answer from those inputs and display the answer in one sentence. <br> 
     - What is your name?  <br> 
     - What time did you wake up? <br> 
     *Your output should be a sentence that tells me who the person is and what time they woke up <br> 

3. Endpoint that accepts 2 numbers. Results should print the following 2 statements: <br> 
     I. The first statement should tell me if the first number is greater than, less than or equal to the second number.  <br> 
     II. The second statement should tell me if the second number is greater than, less than, or equal to the first number.  <br>
   

Peer Review by:  Alicia Bryant <br>
Comment: All endpoints are working. The first endpoint successfully executes the sum of 2 numbers. The second endpoint takes in the users name and time they woke up and works correctly. The third successfully takes two numbers and tells you which is greater/lesser. Great job!
